# openpnp-capture-java

Java bindings for [the openpnp-capture video capture library](https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp-capture). Releases include all platform binaries
and support auto extraction for a "plug and play" experience. Simply install the Maven dependency
and start capturing!

# Usage

## Maven

```
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.openpnp</groupId>
	<artifactId>openpnp-capture-java</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

## Example
```
public static void main(String[] args) {
    OpenPnpCapture capture = new OpenPnpCapture();
    CaptureDevice device = capture.getDevices().get(0);
    CaptureFormat format = device.getFormats().get(0);
    CaptureStream stream = device.openStream(format);
    BufferedImage image = stream.capture();
}
```

# Build
See https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp-capture/releases to pick a release of the native
library to build against and specify it's tag name in the next command.

# Release

To release a new version to Github Releases and Maven central:

Note, on OS X it may be neccessary to run `export GPG_TTY=$(tty)` before running
the below commands. See https://github.com/pstadler/keybase-gpg-github/issues/11.

1. Choose an OpenPnP Capture release from https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp-capture/releases.
2. Update the `before_install` line in `.travis.yml` to include that release name.
3. Update the version in `pom.xml`. Should match release. Append `-n` for sub-releases.
4. Run `./scripts/download-openpnp-capture.sh <RELEASE>`
5. `mvn clean deploy`
6. Tag the release with the new version number and push to master.
7. Travis will build the release and post it to Github.

The deploy step requires credentials and private keys for Sonatype. Please contact
a maintainer to discuss a Maven release.
